# About 

[Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15mgaPBYOn9pM9xxwnZbp1n9Jr5v6IE1m/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117239413994191668415&rtpof=true&sd=true) shows that Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) could be a viable treatment to treat cognitive difficulties for patients with Schizophrenia. I was part of a team that built an app implementing CRT through game-like exercises in an attempt to test and provide data.

# How to run

The app is available at https://memoryattention-1.web.app/home. The app was built for mobile devices. Run chrome's device mode to simulate a phone for the best UI experience.

To run locally, you need to have node.js and npm set up first. (https://nodejs.org/en/). Open a new terminal window.

Install angular

```npm install -g @angular/cli```


Install ionic

```npm install -g @ionic/cli```

Go to the directory

```ionic serve```
