# About 

Research showed that Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) could be a viable treatment to treat cognitive difficulties for patients with Schizophrenia. Based on this research, I was part of a team that build an app/website to create various exercises based on CRT. This app was then used to conduct further research into CRT. The project is also available at https://memoryattention-1.web.app/home.
